# Repository Guidelines

- Ensure each modified file contains version comments as specified in the project plan (`/*  OnlyFans Automation Manager` header and `End of File` footer with date).
- Run `npm test` before every commit and ensure it passes.
- Keep `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, and `.env` out of version control (already in `.gitignore`).
- Update `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` when requirements change or tasks are completed.
- Commit directly to the current branch; do not create new branches.
